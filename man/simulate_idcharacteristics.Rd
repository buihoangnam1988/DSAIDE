\title{Simulation of an infectious disease transmission model with multiple compartments}
\usage{
simulate_idcharacteristics(PopSize = 1000, P0 = 1, tmax = 300, bP = 0,
  bA = 0, bI = 1/1000, gP = 0.5, gA = 0.5, gI = 0.5, f = 0, d = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{PopSize}{specifies the initial number of individuals
(Suceptibles + Infected & Pre-symptomatic).
All other compartments start at 0.}

\item{P0}{initial number of infected, pre-symptomatic hosts,}

\item{tmax}{maximum simulation time, units depend on choice of units for your
parameters}

\item{bP}{level/rate of infectiousness for hosts in the P compartment}

\item{bA}{level/rate of infectiousness for hosts in the A compartment}

\item{bI}{level/rate of infectiousness for hosts in the I compartment}

\item{gP}{rate at which a person leaves the P compartment, which
is the inverse of the average time spent in that compartment}

\item{gA}{rate at which a person leaves the A compartment}

\item{gI}{rate at which a person leaves the A compartment}

\item{f}{fraction of pre-symptomatic individuals that have an asymptomatic infection}

\item{d}{fraction of symptomatic infected hosts that die due to disease}
}
\value{
The function returns the output from the odesolver as a matrix,
with one column per compartment/variable. The first column is time.
}
\description{
Simulation of a compartmental model with several different compartments:
Susceptibles (S), Infected and Pre-symptomatic (P),
Infected and Asymptomatic (A), Infected and Symptomatic (I),
Recovered and Immune (R) and Dead (D)
}
\details{
A compartmental ID model with several states/compartments
is simulated as a set of ordinary differential equations.
}
\section{Warning}{

This function does not perform any error checking. So if you try to do
something nonsensical (e.g. have I0 > PopSize or any negative values or fractions > 1),
the code will likely abort with an error message
}

\examples{
# To run the simulation with default parameters just call this function
result <- simulate_idcharacteristics()
# To choose parameter values other than the standard one, specify them e.g. like such
result <- simulate_idcharacteristics(PopSize = 2000, P0 = 10, tmax = 100, f = 0.1, d = 0.2)
# You should then use the simulation result returned from the function, e.g. like this:
plot(result[,1],result[,2],xlab='Time',ylab='Number Susceptible',type='l')
