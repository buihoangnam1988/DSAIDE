#' Stochastic simulation of an SIR-type model
#' 
#' @description  Simulation of a stochastic SIR type model with the following
#'   compartments: Susceptibles (S), 
#'   Infected and Infectious (I), Recovered and Immune (R)
#'   
#' @param S0 initial number of susceptible hosts
#' @param I0 initial number of infected, symptomatic hosts
#' @param b level/rate of infectiousness for hosts in the I compartment
#' @param g rate at which a person leaves the I compartment
#' @param m the rate at which new individuals enter the model (are born)
#' @param n the rate of natural death (the inverse is the average lifespan)
#' @param rngseed seed for random number generator to allow reproducibility
#' @param tmax maximum simulation time, units depend on choice of units for 
#' your parameters
#' @return The function returns a list. The list has one element, a data frame ts
#' which contains the time series of the simulated model, 
#' with one column per compartment/variable. The first column is time.
#' @details A compartmental SIR model is
#'   simulated. Initial conditions for the R variable is 0. Units of
#'   time depend on the time units chosen for model parameters. The simulation
#'   runs as a stochastic model using the adaptive-tau algorithm as implemented
#'   by ssa.adaptivetau in the adpativetau package. See the manual of this
#'   package for more details. The function returns a list,
#'   with the time series of the
#'   simulated disease as list element ts, with one column per
#'   compartment/variable. The first column is time.
#' @section Warning: This function does not perform any error checking. So if
#'   you try to do something nonsensical (e.g. specify negative parameter values
#'   or fractions > 1), the code will likely abort with an error message.
#' @examples
#' # To run the simulation with default parameters, just call the function:
#' result <- simulate_stochastic_SIR()
#' # To choose parameter values other than the standard one, specify them like this:
#' result <- simulate_stochastic_SIR(S0 = 2000,  tmax = 200, b = 1/100)
#' # You can display or further process the result, like this:
#' plot(result$ts[,'Time'],result$ts[,'S'],xlab='Time',ylab='Number Susceptible',type='l')
#' print(paste('Max number of infected: ',max(result$ts[,'I']))) 
#' @seealso See the Shiny app documentation corresponding to this simulator
#' function for more details on this model. See the manual for the adaptivetau
#' package for details on the stochastic algorithm.
