#Documentation for working on the DSAIDE package and developing new Apps 

**The following information will hopefully help anyone (including the future self of the package author/maintainer) working on the package understand how things work and what to do.**

##To work on package through RStudio
- The following documentation assumes that Rstudio is used.
- Load DSAIDE.Rproj in RStudio. Edit files as needed.
- Optionally, use RStudio tie-in with github to sync project to github (the 'git' tab).

##Package structure 
- The main R functions, i.e. the main menu and the simulation scripts are in the **/R** folder
- Every script that runs one of the simulations underlying each app is called **simulate_XXX.R** and in the **/R** folder
- The **/R** folder also has a few helper/convenience functions
- Folder **/vignettes** contains the files needed for the vignette. This content is copied to **/inst/doc** at some point. Any edits to the vignette should happen in the **/vignettes** folder, not **/inst/doc**.
- Folder **/man** contains the documentation for the R functions in **/R**, automatically generated by roxygen, should not be edited
- Folder **/inst/docsfordevelopers** contains this file and any other potential information for someone wanting to add new apps to the package
- Folder **/inst/simulatorfunctions** contains copies of all the **simulate_XXX.R** code files from **/R** for easy access and editing by users
- The shiny apps are in the **/inst/shinyapps** subfolder (which gets copied to **/shinyapps** in the deployed package). Each App has a corresponding **/www** subfolder which contains the documentation displayed inside each app. The **/www** folder and its content are automatically generated as described below.
- There are a few  folders in the **/inst/shinyapps** directory which do not correspond to shiny apps. Those are:
    - the **/allappdocumentation** folder contains Rmd files for the documentation content of all shiny apps. These files are processed by the **processAllFiles.R** script. See information below. Note that this is not part of the CRAN R package for size reasons, but if you fork the project from github it will be included.
    - The **/media** folder contains figures for each app/model as editable SVG source files and as png files which are the ones included in the apps. The folder also contains a bib file used as part of the documentation (i.e. inside the Rmd files). Note that this is not part of the CRAN R package for size reasons, but if you fork the project from github it will be included.
    - The **/styles** folder contains css styling for the apps and documentation.
    - The **/documentationtemplate** folder contains an Rmd template that can be used as starting point when writing documentation for a new Shiny App.

##Dependency packages for development
- roxygen
- devtools
- rmarkdown for vignette and shiny documentation
- packages needed by DSAIDE: see DESCRIPTION file

##Adding a new App

###Write App code
- Write the main simulator function, **simluate_XXX.R**, following the structure of the existing functions. The easiest approach is likely to copy & modify one of the existing functions.
- Write the Shiny wrapper/App which calls the simulator you just wrote. Again, this is easiest by copying and modifying one of the existing apps.
- Add the simulator function and Shiny app to appropriate directories of the package. Make sure to also place a copy of your simulator in **/inst/simulatorfunctions**.

###Write App documentation
- Write the documentation for the app as R markdown file. A template exists in the **/shinyapps/documentationtemplate** folder. Add information to the template as described in the template. 
- Place your documentation file into the **/shinyapps/allappdocumentation** folder. 
- The first part of the documentation file name must be the same as the name of your new Shiny app/folder. You can have additional text following an underscore, it will be stripped.  
- Run the R script processAllFiles.R inside **/shinyapps/allappdocumentation**. Make sure you are in the right working directory. This function runs through all Rmd files in that folder and turns them into HTML, then processes the HTML files and splits them. Each section in the documentation html file that has a 'shinytabNNN' id will be extracted and placed into a separate html file. Any other sections are ignored. Those 'shinytabNNN' files are later loaded by the shiny UI and displayed inside the app.
- The newly created files will be placed in the www subfolders for each shiny app in **/inst/shinyapps/**
- The **/www** subfolder for each shiny app is deleted and re-created on each run, so don't edit manually
- Naming for newly created html files is shinytab1.html, etc., as well as header.html/footer.html
- lastly, the source HTML files in **/shinyapps/allappdocumentation** will be deleted again.  
- see the comments in **processAllFiles.R** for more details

###Adding App to main menu
- Add your App to the main menu by modifying **dsaidemenu.R** (the script that runs the main menu) and the MainMenu Shiny app.R file (the graphical interface for the main menu).


##To update R documentation and vignette
- Edit documentation inside R functions. 
- Build documentation with Rstudio Build/More/Document or devtools::document()
- Edit vignette inside the **/vignettes** folder.
- To build new vignette, run devtools::build_vignettes()

##Contributing your Apps
- The best way to add your apps to the DSAIDE package is if you fork the package from github, write your app, then send a pull request.
- Alternatively, if you are not familiar with that approach, you can email me your new App files and I can manually integrate them.
- If you plan to contribute new apps, it is best if you contact me (ahandel@uga.edu or via github.com/ahgroup/DSAIDE) and we can discuss beforehand, this will likely make for a smoother process and I can provide additional help as needed.

##To build the DSAIDE package:
- by hand" edit the DESCRIPTION file to make sure it's up to date
- in RStudio, use the functions in the 'build' tab to test and build the package.
- Run clean and rebuild, then build and reload using menu, or devtools::load_all()
- Run the check, fix any errors 

##To use package:
- install either from CRAN or github
- for github install, install devtools package, load it
- then run install_github("ahgroup/DSAIDE")
- library('DSAIDE') 
- dsaidemenu()

##Notes:
- All needed libraries should be loaded via the DESCRIPTION file and not in separate R files
