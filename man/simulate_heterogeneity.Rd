\item{tmax}{maximum simulation time, units of months}

\item{b11}{rate of transmission from infected type 1 host to susceptible type 1 host}

\item{b12}{rate of transmission from infected type 1 host to susceptible type 2 host}

\item{b21}{rate of transmission from infected type 2 host to susceptible type 1 host}

\item{b22}{rate of transmission from infected type 2 host to susceptible type 2 host}

\item{g1}{the rate at which infected type 1 hosts recover}

\item{g2}{the rate at which infected type 2 hosts recover}

\item{w1}{the rate at which type 1 host immunity wanes}

\item{w2}{the rate at which type 2 host immunity wanes}
}
\value{
This function returns the simulation result as obtained from a call
  to the deSolve ode solver
}
\description{
This model allows for the simulation of an ID with 2 types of hosts
}
\details{
A compartmental ID model with several states/compartments
  is simulated as a set of ordinary differential
  equations. The function returns the output from the odesolver as a matrix,
  with one column per compartment/variable. The first column is time.
}
\section{Warning}{

  This function does not perform any error checking. So if you try to do
  something nonsensical (e.g. any negative values or fractions > 1),
  the code will likely abort with an error message
}

\examples{
  # To run the simulation with default parameters just call this function
  result <- simulate_heterogeneity()
  # To choose parameter values other than the standard one, specify them e.g. like such
  result <- simulate_heterogeneity(S10 = 100, S20 = 1e3,  tmax = 100)
  # You should then use the simulation result returned from the function, e.g. like this:
  plot(result[,1],result[,2],xlab='Time',ylab='Number Susceptible',type='l')
