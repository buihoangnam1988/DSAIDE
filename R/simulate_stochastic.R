#' Stochastic simulation of an SEIR-type model
#' 
#' @description  Simulation of a stochastic SEIR type model with the following
#'   compartments: Susceptibles (S), Infected and pre-symptomatic (P), 
#'   Infected and Symptomatic (I), Recovered and Immune (R)
#'   
#' @param S0 initial number of susceptible hosts
#' @param I0 initial number of infected, symptomatic hosts
#' @param bP level/rate of infectiousness for hosts in the P compartment
#' @param bI level/rate of infectiousness for hosts in the I compartment
#' @param gP rate at which a person leaves the P compartment, which is the
#'   inverse of the average time spent in that compartment
#' @param gI rate at which a person leaves the I compartment
#' @param w rate at which recovered persons loose immunity and return to
#'   susceptible state
#' @param lambda the rate at which new individuals enter the model (are born)
#' @param n the rate of natural death (the inverse is the average lifespan)
#' @param tmax maximum simulation time, units depend on choice of units for 
#' your parameters
#' @return The function returns the time series of the simulated model as
#'   matrix, with one column per compartment/variable. The first column is time.
#' @details A compartmental ID model with several states/compartments is
#'   simulated. Initial conditions for the P and R variables are 0. Units of
#'   time depend on the time units chosen for model parameters. The simulation
#'   runs as a stochastic model using the adaptive-tau algorithm as implemented
#'   by ssa.adaptivetau #' in the adpativetau package. See the manual of this
#'   package for more details. The function returns the time series of the
#'   simulated disease as output matrix, with one column per
#'   compartment/variable. The first column is time.
#' @section Warning: This function does not perform any error checking. So if
#'   you try to do something nonsensical (e.g. specify negative parameter values
#'   or fractions > 1), the code will likely abort with an error message
#' @examples
#' # To run the simulation with default parameters 
#' result <- simulate_stochastic()
#' # To choose parameter values other than the standard one, specify them e.g. like this
#' result <- simulate_stochastic(S0 = 2000,  tmax = 200, bP = 1/100)
#' 
#' # You can display or further process the result, e.g. like this
#' plot(result[,'time'],result[,'S'],xlab='Time',ylab='Number Susceptible',type='l')
#' print(paste('Total number of infected at end of simulation:',result[nrow(result),'R'])) 
#' @seealso See the shiny app documentation corresponding to this simulator
#' function for more details on this model. See the manual for the adaptivetau
#' package for details on the stochastic algorithm.
