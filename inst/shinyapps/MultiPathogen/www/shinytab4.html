<h2>Further Information</h2>&#13;
<ul><li>This app (and all others) are structured such that the Shiny part (the graphical interface you are currently using and the server-side function that goes with it) calls an underlying R script which runs the simulation for the model of interest and returns the results.</li>&#13;
<li>For this app, the underlying function running the simulation is called <code>simulate_multipathogen.R</code>. You can call this function directly, without going through the shiny app. Type <code>?simulate_multipathogen</code> into the R console for more information (you need to exit the graphical interface first or start a new R session). If you go that route, you need to use the results returned from this function and produce useful output (such as a plot) yourself.</li>&#13;
<li>You can also modify this R function for your own purposes. That requires some more R coding knowledge.</li>&#13;
<li>To get a quick start explaining how to interact with the simulator functions directly, read the vignette for the package (type <code>vignette('DSAIDE')</code> into the R console).</li>&#13;
