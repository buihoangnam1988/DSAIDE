<h2>Overview</h2>&#13;
<p>This app allows exploration of a very basic infectious disease simulation. The main goal is to get you familiar with the overall setup and ideas behind using these simulations, and how to run them. Read about the model in the “Model” tab. Then do the tasks described in the “What to do” tab.</p>&#13;
