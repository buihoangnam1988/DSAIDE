#' Simulation of a compartmental infectious disease transmission model with 2 types of pathogens
#'
#' @description  This model allows for the simulation of 2 IDs in a single host
#' 
#'
#' @param S0 initial number of susceptible hosts 
#' @param I10 initial number of hosts infected with type 1
#' @param I20 initial number of hosts infected with type 2
#' @param I120 initial number of double infected hosts
#' @param tmax maximum simulation time, units of months
#' @param b1 rate at which type 1 infected hosts transmit
#' @param b2 rate at which type 2 infected hosts transmit
#' @param b12 rate at which double infected hosts transmit
#' @param g1 the rate at which infected type 1 hosts recover
#' @param g2 the rate at which infected type 2 hosts recover
#' @param g12 the rate at which double infected hosts recover
#' @param a fraction of type 1 infections produced by double infected hosts
#' @return This function returns the simulation result as obtained from a call
#'   to the deSolve ode solver.
#' @details A compartmental ID model with several states/compartments
#'   is simulated as a set of ordinary differential
#'   equations. The function returns the output from the odesolver as a matrix,
#'   with one column per compartment/variable. The first column is time.
#' @section Warning:
#'   This function does not perform any error checking. So if you try to do
#'   something nonsensical (e.g. any negative values or fractions > 1),
#'   the code will likely abort with an error message.
#' @examples
#'   # To run the simulation with default parameters just call the function:
#'   result <- simulate_multipathogen()
#'   # To choose parameter values other than the standard one, specify them like such:
#'   result <- simulate_multipathogen(S0 = 100, I20 = 10,  tmax = 100, a = 0.5)
#'   # You should then use the simulation result returned from the function, like this:
#'   plot(result$ts[,"Time"], result$ts[ , "S"], xlab='Time', ylab='Number Susceptible', type='l')
#'   # We could set the infected type 1 host recovery rate at a high level, e.g., 1.2, and
#'   # examine the infected 1 curve.
#'   result <- simulate_multipathogen(S0 = 100, I20 = 10, tmax = 100, g1 = 1.2)
#'   plot(result$ts[,"Time"],result$ts[,"I1"], xlab="Time",ylab="Number Infected Type 1",type="l")
#'   # Additionally, consider making type 1 hosts transmit at a high rate.
#'   result <- simulate_multipathogen(S0 = 100, I20 = 10, tmax = 100, b1 = 2.5)
#'   plot(result$ts[,"Time"],result$ts[,"I1"], xlab="Time",ylab="Number Infected Type 1",type="l")

#' @author Andreas Handel and Spencer Hall
#' @references See e.g. Keeling and Rohani 2008 for SIR models and the
