<h2>What to do</h2>&#13;
<p><strong>The tasks below are described in a way that assumes that everything is in units of DAYS (rate parameters, therefore, have units of inverse days). If any quantity is not given in those units, you need to convert it first (e.g.Â if it says a week, you need to convert it to 7 days).</strong></p>&#13;
<div id="task-1" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 1:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>Set the model parameters such that it corresponds to the following setting:&#13;
<ul><li>Susceptible <em>S<sub>0</sub> = 500</em>, and initially untreated infected host <em>Iu<sub>0</sub> = 1</em>. No other infected hosts <em>It<sub>0</sub> = 0</em> and <em>Ir<sub>0</sub> = 0</em>.</li>&#13;
<li>Set simulation duration, <em>tmax</em>, to approximately half a year.</li>&#13;
<li>Assume that untreated individuals transmit at <em>b<sub>U</sub> = 0.001</em>, treated at <em>b<sub>T</sub> = 0.0005</em>, and resistant at <em>b<sub>R</sub> = 0.0008</em>.</li>&#13;
<li>Assume that the duration in days of the infectious period is <em>g<sub>U</sub> = 1/5</em> for untreated, <em>g<sub>T</sub> = 1/4</em> for treated, and <em>g<sub>R</sub> = 1/5</em> for resistant.</li>&#13;
<li>Set the number of simulations to 20.</li>&#13;
</ul></li>&#13;
<li>With parameters set to correspond to the scenario just described, run the simulation.</li>&#13;
<li>You should see some simulations with outbreaks and some without. For those with outbreaks, you should have around 10-100 susceptible left at the end.</li>&#13;
</ul></div>&#13;
<div id="task-2" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 2:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>With everything as before, set the initial number of untreated infected hosts to 10.</li>&#13;
<li>Run simulations. You should pretty much always get outbreaks. Record the average number of susceptibles left.</li>&#13;
</ul></div>&#13;
<div id="task-3" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 3:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>With the same settings as <em>Task 2</em> turn on treatment ( <em>f &gt; 0</em> ). Run the simulation with fraction receiving treatment, <em>f</em>, at 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 1.</li>&#13;
<li>Observe what happens to the susceptibles, <em>S</em>, at the end of the outbreak as you change treatment. Draw conclusions about the usefulness of treatment.</li>&#13;
</ul></div>&#13;
<div id="task-4" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 4:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>Now allow resistance to be generated during treatment ( <em>c<sub>T</sub> &gt; 0</em> ).</li>&#13;
<li>Set <em>c<sub>T</sub> = 0.2</em> for the fraction of resistant generation from treatment.</li>&#13;
<li>Set treatment level to 0. Contemplate what you expect to see. Run simulations to check.</li>&#13;
<li>Now turn on treatment. Run the simulation with <em>f</em> at 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 1.</li>&#13;
</ul></div>&#13;
<div id="task-5" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 5:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>Repeat task 3 with the number of simulations set to 50. For each of the 5 treatment levels ( <em>f</em> ) record the average number of susceptibles ( <em>S</em> ) left at the end.</li>&#13;
<li>Set the rate of transmission to <em>b<sub>R</sub> = 0.001</em> for resistant hosts, <em>b<sub>U</sub> = 0.001</em> for untreated hosts, and turn resistance generation on <em>c<sub>T</sub> = 0.3</em>.</li>&#13;
<li>Repeat running 50 simulations at a time (you can repeat a few times to get a better idea of random variation). For each of the 5 treatment levels ( <em>f</em> ) record the average number of susceptibles ( <em>S</em> ) left at the end.</li>&#13;
<li>In your head or on a piece of paper, sketch out the relationship between treatment level ( <em>f</em> ) and the number of susceptibles ( <em>S</em> ) left at the end in the absence and presence of resistance evolution, <em>c<sub>T</sub></em>. What do you conclude from that?</li>&#13;
</ul></div>&#13;
<div id="task-6" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 6:</h3>&#13;
<p>Keep exploring. For instance, try the following:</p>&#13;
<ul><li>Turn on resistance generation by treated, <em>c<sub>T</sub></em>, and untreated, <em>c<sub>U</sub></em>.</li>&#13;
<li>Explore how population size, <em>S<sub>0</sub></em>, the fraction of resistance generation ( <em>c<sub>T</sub></em> or <em>c<sub>U</sub></em> ) and fitness of the different strains ( <em>b<sub>T</sub></em> or <em>b<sub>U</sub></em> or <em>b<sub>R</sub></em> ) affect outcomes.</li>&#13;
