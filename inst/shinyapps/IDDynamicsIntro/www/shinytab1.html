<h2>Overview</h2>&#13;
<p>This app allows you to explore a very basic infectious disease simulation. The main goal is to provide familiarity with the overall setup and ideas behind using these simulations, and how to run them. Read about the model in the “Model” tab. Make sure to read the ‘general notes’ section. Then do the tasks described in the “What to do” tab. Finally, check out the “Further Information” tab to learn where you can find some background information on this (and many of the other) apps.</p>&#13;
