#' Simulation of a compartmental infectious disease transmission model including seasonality
#'
#' @description  Simulation of a compartmental model with several different compartments:
#'   Susceptibles (S), Infected and Pre-symptomatic (P),
#'   Infected and Asymptomatic (A), Infected and Symptomatic (I),
#'   Recovered and Immune (R) and Dead (D).
#'
#'   This model includes natural births and deaths and waning immunity.
#'   It also allows for seasonal variation in transmission.
#'   The model is assumed to run in units of months.
#'   This is assumption is hard-coded into the sinusoidally varying
#'   transmission coefficient, which is assumed to have a period of a year
#'   
#'
#' @param PopSize specifies the initial number of individuals
#'   (Suceptibles + Infected & Pre-symptomatic)
#'   All other compartments start at 0
#' @param P0 initial number of infected, pre-symptomatic hosts,
#' @param bP level/rate of infectiousness for hosts in the P compartment
#' @param bA level/rate of infectiousness for hosts in the A compartment
#' @param bI level/rate of infectiousness for hosts in the I compartment
#' @param sigma strength of seasonal/annual sigmoidal variation of transmission rate
#' @param gP rate at which a person leaves the P compartment, which
#'   is the inverse of the average time spent in that compartment
#' @param gA rate at which a person leaves the A compartment
#' @param gI rate at which a person leaves the I compartment
#' @param f fraction of pre-symptomatic individuals that have an asymptomatic infection
#' @param d fraction of symptomatic infected hosts that die due to disease
#' @param w rate at which recovered persons loose immunity and return to susceptible state
#' @param lambda the rate at which new individuals enter the model (are born)
#' @param n the rate of natural death (the inverse it the average lifespan)
#' @param tmax maximum simulation time, in units of months
#' @return This function returns the simulation result as obtained from a call
#'   to the deSolve ode solver
#' @details A compartmental ID model with several states/compartments
#'   is simulated as a set of ordinary differential
#'   equations. The function returns the output from the odesolver as a matrix,
#'   with one column per compartment/variable. The first column is time.
#' @section Warning:
#'   This function does not perform any error checking. So if you try to do
#'   something nonsensical (e.g. have I0 > PopSize or any negative values or fractions > 1),
#'   the code will likely abort with an error message
#' @examples
#'   # To run the simulation with default parameters just call this function
#'   result <- simulate_idpatterns()
#'   # To choose parameter values other than the standard one, specify them e.g. like such
#'   result <- simulate_idpatterns(PopSize = 2000, P0 = 10, tmax = 100, f = 0.1, d = 0.2, sigma = 0.1)
#'   # You should then use the simulation result returned from the function, e.g. like this:
#'   plot(result[,1],result[,2],xlab='Time',ylab='Number Susceptible',type='l')
#' @seealso The UI of the shiny app 'IDPatterns', which is part of this package, contains more details on the model
#' @references See e.g. Keeling and Rohani 2008 for SIR models and the
#'   documentation for the deSolve package for details on ODE solvers
