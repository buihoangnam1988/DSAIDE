<h2>What to do</h2>&#13;
<p><em>A general note: Some of the tasks below (and in future apps) are fairly open ended. In general, I don’t want you to just do the tasks like a check-list. Instead, I want you to explore these simulations. Play with them, query them, go through iterations of thinking what you expect, observing it, and if discrepancies occur, figure out why. Essentially, I want you to “do science/research”.</em></p>&#13;
<div id="task-1" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 1:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>Set the model parameters such that it corresponds to the following setting:&#13;
<ul><li>A population size of 1000, 1 initially infected, presymptomatic host, simulation duration 200 days.</li>&#13;
<li>Assume that only symptomatic individuals transmit, at rate <span class="math inline">\(b_I = 0.001\)</span>.</li>&#13;
<li>Assume that the duration of the presymptomatic, asymptomatic and symptomatic periods are all 5 days long. (Hint: The parameters g<sub>P</sub>, g<sub>A</sub> and g<sub>I</sub> are the inverse of these periods.)</li>&#13;
<li>Assume that there are no asymptomatic infections and nobody dies due to disease.</li>&#13;
</ul></li>&#13;
<li>With parameters set to correspond to the scenario just described, run the simulation.</li>&#13;
<li>Record the number and fraction of susceptible/infected/recovered remaining at the end of the outbreak.<br/></li>&#13;
<li>Check the results with the assumptions for the model and make sure they agree (you shouldn’t get any deaths, no asymptomatics, etc.)</li>&#13;
<li>From the graph, contemplate how you would estimate the day at which the outbreak peaks. What’s the problem? How would you solve it?</li>&#13;
<li>Run the simulation again, with the same values you just had. Does anything change? Why (not)?</li>&#13;
</ul></div>&#13;
<div id="task-2" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 2:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>Assume now that half of the infected are asymptomatic. Don’t change any other assumption.</li>&#13;
<li>What do you expect to get for the number/fraction of S/I/R at the end of the outbreak and the time at which the outbreak peaks?</li>&#13;
<li>Run another simulation, record the same values as above.</li>&#13;
<li>Compare your expectations with the results. How do they agree/disagree? Does it make sense? Anything surprising happening?</li>&#13;
</ul></div>&#13;
<div id="task-3" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 3:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>Now assume that the asymptomatics transmit at the same rate as the symptomatics. Leave everything as in #2.</li>&#13;
<li>How do you expect the results to change? (Try to make as precise/quantitative a prediction as you can)</li>&#13;
<li>Run another simulation, record the same values as above.</li>&#13;
<li>Compare your expectations with the results. How do they agree/disagree? Does it make sense? Anything surprising happening?</li>&#13;
</ul></div>&#13;
<div id="task-4" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 4:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>Next, let’s assume that half the symptomatic infected die. Leave everything as in #3.</li>&#13;
<li>How do you expect the results to change?</li>&#13;
<li>Run another simulation, record the same values as above.</li>&#13;
<li>Compare your expectations with the results. How do they agree/disagree? Does it make sense? Anything surprising happening?</li>&#13;
</ul></div>&#13;
<div id="task-5" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 5:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>Further explore how changes in the infectiousness of the different groups (b<sub>P</sub>, b<sub>A</sub>, b<sub>I</sub>) and the average time a person spends in each of those states (g<sub>P</sub>, g<sub>A</sub>, g<sub>I</sub>) affects the infection dynamics.</li>&#13;
<li>Every time, think about what you expect to get, then run the simulation, compare your expectations with the results. Then make sense of it.</li>&#13;
</ul></div>&#13;
<div id="task-6" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 6:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>Further explore how changes in the fraction becoming asymptomatic and fraction dying does (or does not) affect the infection dynamics.</li>&#13;
<li>Every time, think about what you expect to get, then run the simulation, compare your expectations with the results. Then make sense of it.</li>&#13;
</ul></div>&#13;
<div id="task-7" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 7:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>Keep exploring.</li>&#13;
<li>Think about real-world IDs and interventions. What groups would those interventions target, how would that affect the outcome?</li>&#13;
</ul></div>&#13;
