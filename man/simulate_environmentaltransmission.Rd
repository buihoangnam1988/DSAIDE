\title{Simulation of a compartmental infectious disease transmission model illustrating environmental transmission}
\usage{
simulate_environmentaltransmission(S0 = 1000, I0 = 1, E0 = 0,
  tmax = 120, bd = 0.01, be = 0, m = 0, n = 0, g = 1, p = 0,
  c = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{S0}{initial number of susceptible hosts}

\item{I0}{initial number of infected hosts}

\item{E0}{initial number of pathogen in environment}

\item{tmax}{maximum simulation time, units of months}

\item{bd}{rate of direct transmission}

\item{be}{rate of environmental transmission}

\item{m}{rate of births of hosts}

\item{n}{the rate of natural death of hosts}

\item{g}{the rate at which infected hosts recover/die}

\item{p}{the rate at which infected host shed pathogen in the environment}

\item{c}{the rate at which pathogen in the enviroment decays}
}
\value{
This function returns the simulation result as obtained from a call
  to the deSolve ode solver
}
\description{
This model allows for the simulation of an environmentally transmitted infectious disease
}
\details{
A compartmental ID model with several states/compartments
  is simulated as a set of ordinary differential
  equations. The function returns the output from the odesolver as a matrix,
  with one column per compartment/variable. The first column is time.
}
\section{Warning}{

  This function does not perform any error checking. So if you try to do
  something nonsensical (e.g. any negative values or fractions > 1),
  the code will likely abort with an error message
}

\examples{
  # To run the simulation with default parameters just call this function
  result <- simulate_environmentaltransmission()
  # To choose parameter values other than the standard one, specify them e.g. like such
  result <- simulate_environmentaltransmission(S0 = 100, E0 = 1e5,  tmax = 100)
  # You should then use the simulation result returned from the function, e.g. like this:
  plot(result[,1],result[,2],xlab='Time',ylab='Number Susceptible',type='l')
