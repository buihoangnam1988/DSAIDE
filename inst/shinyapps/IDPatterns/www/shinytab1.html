<h2>Overview</h2>&#13;
<p>This app allows you to explore a model that tracks the same compartments as the <em>Characteristics of ID</em> model. If you haven’t yet explored the <em>Characteristics of ID</em> model, I suggest you try out that one first. The model for this app adds a few more processes. It includes natural births and deaths of hosts, seasonal variation in transmission, and waning immunity.</p>&#13;
<p>Also note that for this model, the time units are in months, not days. Read about the model in the “Model” tab. Then do the tasks described in the “What to do” tab.</p>&#13;
