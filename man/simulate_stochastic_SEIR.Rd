\title{Stochastic simulation of an SEIR-type model}
\usage{
simulate_stochastic_SEIR(S0 = 1000, I0 = 10, tmax = 100, bE = 0,
  bI = 1/1000, gE = 0.5, gI = 0.5, w = 0, m = 0, n = 0,
  rngseed = 100)
}
\arguments{
\item{S0}{initial number of susceptible hosts}

\item{I0}{initial number of infected, symptomatic hosts}

\item{tmax}{maximum simulation time, units depend on choice of units for 
your parameters}

\item{bE}{level/rate of infectiousness for hosts in the E compartment}

\item{bI}{level/rate of infectiousness for hosts in the I compartment}

\item{gE}{rate at which a person leaves the E compartment, which is the
inverse of the average time spent in that compartment}

\item{gI}{rate at which a person leaves the I compartment}

\item{w}{rate at which recovered persons lose immunity and return to
susceptible state}

\item{m}{the rate at which new individuals enter the model (are born)}

\item{n}{the rate of natural death (the inverse is the average lifespan)}

\item{rngseed}{seed for random number generator to allow reproducibility}
}
\value{
The function returns a list. The list has one element, a data frame ts
which contains the time series of the simulated model, 
with one column per compartment/variable. The first column is time.

\description{
Simulation of a stochastic SEIR type model with the following
  compartments: Susceptibles (S), Infected and pre-symptomatic/exposed (E), 
  Infected and Symptomatic (I), Recovered and Immune (R)
}
\details{
A compartmental ID model with several states/compartments is
  simulated. Initial conditions for the E and R variables are 0. Units of
  time depend on the time units chosen for model parameters. The simulation
  runs as a stochastic model using the adaptive-tau algorithm as implemented
  by ssa.adaptivetau() in the adpativetau package. See the manual of this
  package for more details.
}
\section{Warning}{
 This function does not perform any error checking. So if
  you try to do something nonsensical (e.g. specify negative parameter values
  or fractions > 1), the code will likely abort with an error message.
}

\examples{
# To run the simulation with default parameters, just call the function:
result <- simulate_stochastic_SEIR()
# To choose parameter values other than the standard one, specify them like this:
result <- simulate_stochastic_SEIR(S0 = 2000,  tmax = 200, bE = 1/100)
# You can display or further process the result, like this:
plot(result$ts[,'Time'],result$ts[,'S'],xlab='Time',ylab='Number Susceptible',type='l')
print(paste('Max number of infected: ',max(result$ts[,'I']))) 
}

See the Shiny app documentation corresponding to this simulator
function for more details on this model. See the manual for the adaptivetau
package for details on the stochastic algorithm.
